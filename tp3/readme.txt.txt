DBZ: 112 Battle!
----------------------------------
Description: DBZ: 112 Battle is a turn-based, puzzle/strategy game where you and an opponent battle it out with
teams of 7 characters each. When in battle, match up orbs of the same color to collect ki, the
more you collect the stronger the attack! Gather 12 ki to do a Super Attack, which does the most
damage! A player wins when all 7 characters on the opposing side are defeated!
----------------------------------
How to Run: Just open the python file, run the code, and have fun!
----------------------------------
Libraries: None needed!
----------------------------------
Shortcuts: There are no shortcuts (since this is a turn-based game, most of the complex code can be seen on the
first turn, and is just repeated until the game is over!)

Hope you enjoy DBZ: 112 Battle! :)
